# Sorting in visual
A project with ~1.5 hours per day is allocated - If I have no assignment from 22:00 ~ 23:30. 

Trying to replicate some sorting actions visually, motived by 'Sounds of Sorting'.

Therefore, I created this project to apply what I've learned from 'Introducing Python' by Bill Lubanovic. This will start off by CLI application and now working on PyQt5 for UI.

Just like last project, I barely know about python - There's ton of things to learn to be more pythonic.
