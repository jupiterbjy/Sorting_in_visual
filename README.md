# Sorting in visual
A project with ~2 hours per day is allocated. Trying to replicate some sorting actions visually.

Since I can't do anything with UI or anything with Web IDE, nor I can use UAC priviledge in army pc either.

Therefore, I created this project to apply what I've learned from 'Introducing Python' by Bill Lubanovic. This will gonna be console application unless I find a way to run UI app in GoorumIDE.

Just like last project, I know nothing about python - There's ton of things to learn to be more pythonic.
